# Tiyoweh

Tiyoweh is a mindfulness and stillness-focused experience designed primarily for Apple Watch.  
The app emphasises minimal interaction, gentle feedback, and calm visual language to support meditation, breathwork, and awareness throughout the day.

## About Tiyoweh

*Tiyoweh* is a Seneca-language word describing the stillness we encounter when the mind’s internal chatter falls quiet. It refers to a Native American spiritual discipline often translated as **“entering the silence.”** This silence is not emptiness, but a calm, attentive presence that exists beneath thought.

Tiyoweh invites a daily **Spirit-Ritual** — a simple, repeatable practice that nourishes the spirit through consistency rather than effort. Practised faithfully, it can help reduce stress and anxiety, deepen self-awareness, extend attention, cultivate gratitude and kindness, support recovery, and gently transform fear into peace. Like any discipline, the key is practice. Many people find that 30 to 60 minutes a day opens the door to this state of stillness.

If you’re worried that you won’t be able to “find” Tiyoweh, there’s no need to. Everyone enters this state naturally during sleep, and anyone can learn to touch it while awake. There is no single path. Some arrive through meditation, yoga, Pilates, or Tai Chi; others through prayer, dance, or personal daily rituals. Tiyoweh supports all of these approaches and is well suited for daily spiritual practice, training rest days, and recovery work such as Step Eleven.

## Why This App Exists

I created Tiyoweh to support mindful practice on Apple Watch in a way that is **quiet, flexible, and intentional**. The app provides a simple timer that works across a wide range of activities while accurately recording **Mindful Minutes** in Apple Health. Corresponding sessions are also recorded in the Apple Workout app, allowing mindfulness and movement to sit naturally alongside daily activity.

The Apple Watch experience is intentionally minimal, designed to support presence rather than distraction. A companion iPhone app extends this experience with customisation, goals, and gentle reminders — without pulling attention away from practice.
